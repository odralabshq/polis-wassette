  # GitHub Actions updates are temporarily disabled because agentic workflow
  # lock files (*.lock.yml) are auto-generated from *.md source files.
  # Dependabot cannot distinguish between regular workflows and generated
  # lock files, so we must disable all GitHub Actions updates until a
  # mechanism is implemented to keep .md and .lock.yml files in sync.
  #
  # To update GitHub Actions versions in regular workflows: manual updates.
  # To update GitHub Actions versions in agentic workflows: update .md
  # source files and recompile with 'gh aw compile'.
