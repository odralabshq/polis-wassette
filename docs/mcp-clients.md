Alternatively, you can add the Wassete MCP server to VS Code from the command line using the `code` command in a bash/zsh or PowerShell terminal:

### bash/zsh

```bash
code --add-mcp '{"name":"Wassette","command":"wassette","args":["run"]}'
```

### PowerShell

```powershell
 code --% --add-mcp "{\"name\":\"wassette\",\"command\":\"wassette\",\"args\":[\"run\"]}"
```

You can list and configure MCP servers in VS Code by running the command `MCP: List Servers` in the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).

## Cursor

To add Wassette to Cursor, you'll need to manually configure it in your MCP settings. Follow the [Cursor MCP setup guide](https://docs.cursor.com/en/context/mcp#setup) to add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wassette": {
      "command": "wassette",
      "args": ["run"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Claude Code

First, [install Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code?tab=readme-ov-file#get-started) (requires Node.js 18 or higher):

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

Add the Wassette MCP server to Claude Code using the following command:

```bash
claude mcp add -- wassette wassette run
```

This will configure the Wassette MCP server as a local stdio server that Claude Code can use to execute Wassette commands and interact with your data infrastructure.

You can verify the installation by running:
```bash
claude mcp list
```

To remove the server if needed:
```bash
claude mcp remove wassette
```

## Gemini CLI

First, [install Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart) (requires Node.js 20 or higher):

```bash
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
```

To add the Wassette MCP server to Gemini CLI, you need to configure it in your settings file at `~/.gemini/settings.json`. Create or edit this file to include:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wassette": {
      "command": "wassette",
      "args": ["run"]
    }
  }
}
```

Quit the Gemini CLI and reopen it.

Open Gemini CLI and verify the installation by running `/mcp` inside of Gemini CLI.

## OpenAI Codex CLI

First, [install Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-running-codex-cli) (requires Node.js) using either npm or Homebrew:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

Or with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install codex
```

Add the Wassette MCP server to Codex CLI using the following command:

```bash
codex mcp add wassette wassette run
```

Run `codex` to start the CLI.

Verify the installation by running `/mcp` inside of Codex CLI.
